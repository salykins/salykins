### Hi there 👋, I'm Sean!

## Introduction
- 🔭 I’m currently working on implementing an identity mangement system using Amazon Cognito
- 🤔 I'm also currently working on maintaining legacy PHP systems that were poorly design and very fragile!
- 🌱 I love software design patterns!  My favorites are message queues, command query responsibility segregation, event souring, and kappa (big data). 
- 😄 I love working in c# and Azure functions!  Any day I get to use those 2 is a good day!
-  ⚡ My favorite domain areas are identity & access mgmt (IAM), privacy, and big data!
- 💬 Ask me about IAM, privacy, or big data!
- 🏋️ Fun fact: I go for 2 dog walks every day!
